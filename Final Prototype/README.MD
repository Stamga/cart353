## Artist statement:

Sonus is the result of my desire to go beyond common text-based communication apps, and to explore sound-driven forms of online collaboration. Users are invited to uncover their inner creativity by generating and observing instrument-inspired sounds and abstract sound visualization. The ultimate goal of Sonus is the discovery of unexpected user behaviours and unique outcomes.
 
Sonus could be used to communicate back and forth with sounds, to play and compose music together, or perhaps to make as much noise as possible. Hopefully, the result goes beyond these expected outcomes. While the main focus is on the audio collaboration, it is possible that the visuals take on an unexpected level of importance, where users attempt to make their visualization interact with those of other users.

Sonus was inspired by real-life events. Once, at the office where I work, a single person started tapping their foot. Others were intrigued and began to participate, taking whichever object they could find to jam to the beat. A single beat produced a spontaneous music jam session. Sonus brings this type of participative interaction to the web. Random instruments are assigned to each user who enters the “room”, and the choice of what they do with this tool is all theirs.

Instead of being bombarded with options, the minimal audiovisual web space is voluntarily interfaceless, to let people discover and use the “room” how they see fit. Special attributes, such as instrument type, color and position, are assigned automatically to each user as they join the room, in order to make the website instantly accessible and seamless, while allowing for a completely different experience every time they visit Sonus.

The openness of Sonus breaks away from the tedious process of developing an online persona. You don’t need to sign in and create an account or configure anything. You just access the page on any device; whether you use a laptop, tablet or phone, you are instantly connected with all of the other users that are on that same page.

The anonymity and simplicity allow for rich, instant interactions, while also encouraging people from around the world to act and react as if they were in the same actual room. The abstraction of other users actions into simplistic color bursts and smooth synthesizer sounds makes Sonus easy to understand, regardless of language, culture or age, promoting collaboration between those who would have difficulties understanding each other otherwise.

## Required to run:

In order to run the client portion of the project, with it connecting to the server portion of the project, it must be uploaded to any webserver. It will connect to the database and server files hosted on "stamga.com/sonus" by default, meaning that it will behave the same way as going to "stamga.com/sonus".

To run the entire project on a webserver, you must create a MySQL database, with a table accepting all of the variables sent in "server.php" and change the connection settings in the "connect.php" file.
